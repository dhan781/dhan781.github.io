Linear algebra is the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional vector spaces.
Eventually we will learn what all these terms mean. In this chapter we will define
vector spaces and discuss their elementary properties.
In linear algebra, better theorems and more insight emerge if complex numbers
are investigated along with real numbers. Thus we will begin by introducing the
complex numbers and their basic properties.
We will generalize the examples of a plane and of ordinary space to 𝐑
𝑛
and
𝐂
𝑛
, which we then will generalize to the notion of a vector space. As we will see,
a vector space is a set with operations of addition and scalar multiplication that
satisfy natural algebraic properties.
Then our next topic will be subspaces, which play a role for vector spaces
analogous to the role played by subsets for sets. Finally, we will look at sums
of subspaces (analogous to unions of subsets) and direct sums of subspaces.
